## About Me
Hi! I’m a Frontend developer with a passion for creating impactful digital products.  

In 2020, I successfully launched a Unity game, which reached over 50,000 downloads, and sold it three months after its release.  

I’ve been developing websites for around two years, specializing in **React**, **TypeScript (TSX)**, and the **Vite framework**.  
In 2022, I completed the **WePro Web Development course** with a perfect score. To date, I’ve developed over **100 websites**.  

Currently, I am a student at **St. Petersburg State University**, specializing in **Applied Mathematics and Programming**, where I am deepening my knowledge of cutting-edge technologies and problem-solving.

I also tried getting into Arduino but haven’t been able to fully dive into it yet due to a lack of time.



## Language Proficiency
- **Uzbek**: Advanced
- **Russian**: Intermediate
- **English**: Beginner
